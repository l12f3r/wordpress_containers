# lizferLinux on containers

For this small project, I want to bring back the [lizferLinux Wordpress blog](https://github.com/l12f3r/lizferLinux) (who went down due to lack of payment to Digital Ocean), but without all the hassle of configuring a LAMP environment - I will provision a Wordpress environment using containers (an AWS ECS cluster with Fargate), consuming from MariaDB (in AWS Aurora).
